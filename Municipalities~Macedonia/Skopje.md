## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Skopje** is the capital and largest city of North Macedonia. 
> It lies in the northern part of the country, in the Skopje Valley along the Vardar River, 
> and is the political, economic, and cultural centre of the country. 
> 
> As of the 2021 census, the city had a population of 526,502. Skopje covers 571.46 km2 (220.64 sq mi) and includes both urban and rural areas, bordered by several municipalities and close to the borders of Kosovo and Serbia.
>
> The area of Skopje has been continuously inhabited since at least the Chalcolithic period. The city — known as Scupi at the time — was founded in the late 1st century during the rule of Domitian, and abandoned in 518 after an earthquake destroyed the city. It was rebuilt under Justinian I. It became a significant settlement under the First Bulgarian Empire, the Serbian Empire (when it served briefly as a capital), and later under the Ottoman Empire, which ruled the city for over five centuries. In 1912, following the Balkan Wars, Skopje was annexed by the Kingdom of Serbia. It became part of Yugoslavia after World War I and, following World War II, became the capital of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia, one of its constituent republics. In 1963, a major earthquake devastated the city, after which it was largely rebuilt with international assistance. Skopje became the capital of independent North Macedonia in 1991.
>
> The city has a diverse population, with ethnic Macedonians forming a majority and Albanians a significant minority, alongside Roma, Turks, Serbs, and others. It is also religiously diverse, with Orthodox Christianity and Islam being the most widely practised faiths. Skopje is the site of major educational and cultural institutions, including the Ss. Cyril and Methodius University, the Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts, and the National Theatre.
>
> Skopje is the country's centre of government and business and produces a significant share of the national GDP. Its economy is based on industry, trade, services, and finance. The city has undergone major transformations in recent decades, notably through the controversial Skopje 2014 project, which aimed to reshape the city centre with neoclassical buildings and monuments.
